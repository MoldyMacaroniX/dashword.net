The former top 1 Geometry Dash creator, Viprin, has been dethroned after more than half a decade at the top of the creator leaderboard.

In Geometry Dash developed by RobTop Games, players can create and upload levels. If these uploaded levels are good, [they get rated by RobTop](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-how-to-make-a-featured-level-2022/).

When a level gets rated, [it gives the creator a certain amount of creator points](/posts/top-geometry-dash-creator-viprin-is-about-to-be-dethroned/). The creators leaderboard ranks the top 100 creators with these points.

Previously, Viprin dominated this position. But now, quick creator YunHaSeu has surpassed Viprin after a stretched creator point grind.

This is incredible to see. In an era where people deem the creating standards to be too high, seeing someone still manage to take the top 1 creator spot is incredible.

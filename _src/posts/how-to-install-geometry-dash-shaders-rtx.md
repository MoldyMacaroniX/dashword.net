G﻿eometry Dash shaders and RTX gained traction about a year ago but can still be seen today. Surprisingly, many people are unaware on how to get shaders and RTX.

First things first, this is done with a program called **ReShade**. This program allows you to apply certain effects to games, including the so-called "shaders" or "RTX" [you may have seen some YouTubers use](/posts/growth-is-not-an-excuse-for-bad-videos/).

So here is a guide on how to install this in only 5 minutes!

# How To Install Geometry Dash Shaders & RTX (ReShade)

1. After closing your game, open your preferred browser and go to [https://reshade.me/](https://reshade.me/)


2. Click the **Download** button and download the latest version


3. Once downloaded, run the downloaded .exe file and wait for it to load fully


4. Click **Geometry Dash (GeometryDash.exe)**, select **OpenGL**, then select **Next**


5. Click all the effects (make all the boxes ticked) that you'd like to install, or if you want all of them simply click **Uncheck all** then **Check all**


6. Select **Next**, wait for all selected effects to install, then select **Finished**


7. Open your game and click the **Home** key on your keyboard (usually near the number pad). You will now have a tab where you can mess around with all the effects. Use the home key to toggle this menu on and off

{% alert %}
Not all keyboards have the Home key. If yours does not, you can bind another key to it in your keyboard settings.
{% endalert %}

The recommended effects used for the shaders and RTX look are called **Bloom**. Try some of them out and see how it looks!

G﻿eometry Dash shaders and RTX are used a lot on [extreme demons from the Demon List](/categories/demonlist/), including some of the [hardest levels ever made](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-what-is-the-hardest-level-ever-made/).

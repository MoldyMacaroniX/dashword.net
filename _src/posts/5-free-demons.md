Welcome to the "5 Free Demons no one is talking about," list. In this list I'll showcase 5 extremely easy demons that you *hopefully* haven't heard of. This list is in no particular order. Let's begin!

# Altos Odyssey

As our first level on this list, [Altos Odyssey, by GD Charz.](https://youtu.be/oo1phskaGrg) The level doesn't really have any difficulty spikes, and is overall a nice and enjoyable cakewalk. However, beware of overlays past 23%, as it does cover up some of the gameplay. Another thing to beware of, is the timing at 83%, as it can throw off some players! 

Personal Rating: 6.5 stars.

# Pipe Rush II

As our second level, we have [Pipe Rush II by Fofii.](https://youtu.be/ZvhnqlgEcvw) Despite being inconsistent in difficulty, most parts are extremely easy to sight read, excluding some ship parts that could be harder for lower-end devices. With one practice run, this will hopefully be a breeze!

Personal Rating: 7.5 stars.

# InsidiouS

Our next level is [InsidiouS by Wintter.](https://youtu.be/fyhDak4VXAc) The level does feature a few tricky parts like the 11% wave, *however, it's pretty open,* but that could usually be fixed with a practice run. The level after the first wave turns into a 7-8 star, and around 60% forward, turns into a 5 star. In addition to that, it also features a 25% end screen, further adding onto how easy the level is!

Personal Rating: 7.5 stars.

# Third Rail

Despite [Third Rail by Umbraleviathan](https://youtu.be/IsiC4mdfjNE) being the hardest level on this list, it's probably the most fun too. However, "It's not a little something for everyone," - (Evil) IGN. Anyhow, it isn't for everyone because of it's game mechanics, which are a little hard to read at times. Definitely recommend a practice run or two!

Personal Rating: 9.2 stars.

# If Among Us Was Lv 2 

[If Among Us Was Lv 2 by Knoeppel](https://youtu.be/BsKLABBfUEQ) is definitely the worst on this list, but it's relatively easy as well, ignoring the tricky 24% wave. Also, beware of 28%, since you can't slide on the upper block into the cube portal. Also, the last obstacle is a straight fly that could catch you off guard at 82%, so be careful! Luckily, the level has a 18% end screen!

Personal Rating: 7.7 stars.

Geometry Dash 2.21 is the next update coming to Geometry Dash that will include features such as [Versus Mode](/posts/robtop-cancels-geometry-dash-2-2-versus-mode-after-6-years-of-development/), the map, and events. Although there is no set release date, RobTop has revealed information that hint at when update 2.21 will release.

# Geometry Dash 2.21 Release Date

RobTop has confirmed that [he wants to start releasing smaller updates](/posts/robtop-confirms-geometry-dash-2-3-will-come-out-6-months-from-when-he-starts/) after the wait for the [previous update took nearly seven years](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-released/). Because of this, RobTop confirmed that he doesn't want to spend too long on updates once he starts working on them.

Instead, it is possible that RobTop has yet to start meaningfully working on Geometry Dash 2.21. Due to having to update the [free versions of Geometry Dash](/posts/how-to-play-geometry-dash-lite-meltdown-world-subzero-for-free/), recruit new artists for the [Music Library](/posts/ncs-added-to-geometry-dash-music-library/), and [collab with NCS on the NCS Gauntlet Contest](/posts/geometry-dash-ncs-gauntlet-contest-all-winners-results/), RobTop has been very busy, so it is understandable that he may not have had all the time in the world to work on 2.21.

That being said, now that all of these events have concluded, this gives RobTop a lot of time to start working on [Geometry Dash 2.21](/categories/2.2/). We predict that **Geometry Dash 2.21 will release by April 2025**. This prediction is due to RobTop saying that he planned to only spend six months on Geometry Dash 2.3, and seeing as update 2.21 is a smaller update than that, we can expect it to take less time and be ready within six months, or by April 2025.

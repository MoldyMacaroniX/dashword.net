Geometry Dash 2.21 is the next update coming to Geometry Dash that will include features such as [Versus Mode](/posts/robtop-cancels-geometry-dash-2-2-versus-mode-after-6-years-of-development/), the new level [Explorers](/posts/explorers-delayed-until-after-geometry-dash-2-2/), the map, and events. Although there is no set release date, RobTop has revealed information that hint at when update 2.21 will release.

# Geometry Dash 2.21 Release Date

RobTop has confirmed that [he wants to start releasing smaller updates](/posts/robtop-confirms-geometry-dash-2-3-will-come-out-6-months-from-when-he-starts/) after the wait for the [previous update took nearly seven years](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-released/). Because of this, RobTop confirmed that he doesn't want to spend too long on updates once he starts working on them.

Instead, it is possible that RobTop has yet to start meaningfully working on Geometry Dash 2.21. Due to having to update the [free versions of Geometry Dash](/posts/how-to-play-geometry-dash-lite-meltdown-world-subzero-for-free/), recruit new artists for the [Music Library](/posts/ncs-added-to-geometry-dash-music-library/), and [collab with NCS on the NCS Gauntlet Contest](/posts/geometry-dash-ncs-gauntlet-contest-all-winners-results/), RobTop has been very busy, so it is understandable that he may not have had all the time in the world to work on 2.21.

That being said, now that all of these events have concluded, this gives RobTop a lot of time to start working on [Geometry Dash 2.21](/categories/2.2/). We predict that **Geometry Dash 2.21 will release by April 2025**. This prediction is due to RobTop saying that he planned to only spend six months on Geometry Dash 2.3, and seeing as update 2.21 is a smaller update than that, we can expect it to take less time and be ready within six months, or by April 2025.

# New Features in Geometry Dash 2.21

Geometry Dash 2.21 will not be as big an update as version 2.2, but will still contain a bunch of new features. In specific, it will contain all features that were planned for version 2.2, but rejected in order to [meet the deadline for Geometry Dash 2.2](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-might-get-delayed-to-2024/).

These features include Versus Mode, the [second sneak peek level, Explorers](/posts/geometry-dash-new-sneak-peek-analysis/), the map, and events. But in addition to these features, RobTop has expressed interest in adding the following features:

- Multiplayer mode. RobTop has commented about the [Globed multiplayer mod](/posts/geometry-dash-multiplayer-how-to-download-and-install/) and expressed interest in adding official multiplayer support to the game.
- Click Between Frames. RobTop has also tested his own version of the popular [Click Between Frames](/posts/geometry-dash-click-between-frames-mod-download-and-install/) mod. While his version [will not be the same](/posts/geometry-dash-2-207-news-multiplayer-click-between-frames-ignore-damage-fix/), if implemented, it should even the playing field for all Geometry Dash players, regardless of device.
- More Gauntlets. While Gauntlets are server-side, meaning new Gauntlets can be added without updating the game, that only applies to Gauntlets that already have their files in the game. So we may see more Gauntlets added in Geometry Dash 2.21.

With all this in mind, what do you think of Geometry Dash 2.21? Do you think it will be worth the 10-months-and-counting wait, or would you like to see more features added? Let us know in the comments!

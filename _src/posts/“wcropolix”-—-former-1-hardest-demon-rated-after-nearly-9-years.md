“WcropoliX,” one of Geometry Dash’s most notorious former Top 1 levels, was officially rated by the developer [RobTop](https://www.dashword.net/posts/robtop-face-reveal-all-known-pictures-of-robtop-games/) Tuesday — nearly 9 years after its original release and verification.

**[WcropoliX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKzbJ0WC8I8&pp=ygUJd2Nyb3BvbGl4)** is an [Extreme Demon](https://www.dashword.net/posts/amethyst-new-hardest-level-in-geometry-dash/) created by BlassCFB, Marpha, Mero and Nifecap in the 2.0 Update. It is a heavily buffed remake of “[Wcropolis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGmk-h6AomY&pp=ygUJd2Nyb3BvbGlz)” by KeyDashMaster, which was also a remake of the popular Update 1.9 Insane Demon “[Acropolis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSAfuCZ2cks&pp=ygUMYWNyb3BvbGlzIGdk0gcJCd4JAYcqIYzv)” by [Zobros](https://www.youtube.com/@GeometryDashZobros).

Known for its intense straight-fly sections and tight wave spam, WcropoliX was considered the hardest level in the game at the time of its verification. **[BlassCFB](https://www.youtube.com/@BlassCFB)**, a former top player at the time, announced the project on April 12, 2016, with an [early preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Anax7mAaom0) uploaded to his YouTube channel.

The [final preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPglgejE5Zw) of the level was released on June 20, 2016, showcasing new decoration and gameplay buffs that increased the difficulty above the hardest demon at the time, [Bloodbath](https://www.dashword.net/posts/geometry-dash-level-bloodbath-reaches-50-million-downloads/).

BlassCFB announced soon after that he was going to attempt to verify WcropoliX, achieving progress such as [77%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTt0KIaPzWg) on July 25, 2016. 6 days later, he [verified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ2PsY1BymE) the level on July 31, after only 8,240 attempts.

Upon release, the level sent shockwaves throughout the community. The level quickly amassed hundreds of thousands of downloads but remained unrated by the game's developer, RobTop. This left the level in limbo for nearly a decade. It was ineligible on sites like the [Pointercrate Demonlist](https://pointercrate.com/demonlist/) and the [AREDL](https://aredl.net/), as they require levels to have star ratings to earn placements, meaning WcropoliX was never able to be officially crowned the hardest demon in Geometry Dash.

However, on June 17, 2025, the community was shocked to discover that WcropoliX finally received its Extreme Demon rating, with thousands of people flocking to social media to express their excitement.

"I'm really happy to see this rated finally," says popular YouTuber and pro player **[AeonAir](https://www.youtube.com/@AeonAir)**. "I love this level so far, this level's awesome... Blass\[CFB] is the goat dude, I f\*\**ing love Blass. Blass is one of my all-time inspirations."

WcropoliX is available to play on the Geometry Dash servers! To try it for yourself, the ID is **22183448**.

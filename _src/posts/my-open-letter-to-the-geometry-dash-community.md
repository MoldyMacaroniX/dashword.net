Myself and other YouTubers believe that historically, many great channels deserving of a Geometry Dash Awards nomination have been left out.

That is why I curated a list of some of the best Geometry Dash videos released in 2024. I encourage the community to push for some of these to get nominated!

If you don't know what to vote for, vote for one of these!

RobTop Games has just submitted [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) to stores for review. Geometry Dash's App Store page has been updated, indicating that Geometry Dash 2.2 has been sent to stores for review.

This is the final step before releasing the update for everyone to play.

While RobTop claimed update 2.2 was "about to be completely finished for release" [back in November](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-is-finished-release-scheduled-for-early-december/), some sources indicate that RobTop Games has been working on update 2.2 all this time since then due to discovering more bugs.

However, it appears RobTop is actually finished Geometry Dash 2.2 this time around.

While this news would normally mean we can expect the update to release within a week, due to the holidays, it may take stores like the App Store and Google Play Store more time to review the update. Once Apple, Google, and Steam accept the update, it will be ready for release.

While it is still possible that [Geometry Dash 2.2 gets delayed to 2024](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-might-get-delayed-to-2024/), if it is true that RobTop has submitted the update now, then we might see it this month or at least in very early January of 2024.

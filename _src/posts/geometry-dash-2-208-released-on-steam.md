After over a year since the previous update, Geometry Dash 2.208 has been released! This update adds the famous Click Between Frames mod, more leaderboards, new Gauntlets, and more.

While originally only being available on Steam, the update has now been released on iOS and Android.

# Geometry Dash 2.208 Features

- [Click Between Frames](/posts/geometry-dash-click-between-frames-mod-download-and-install/), called Click Between / On Steps in-game
- Leaderboards for Moons, Demons, and User Coins
- New Gauntlets
- New trace system in the editor
- More social media buttons on account profiles
- Bug fixes and other small tweaks

The [official Geometry Dash Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/geometrydash) also noted that update 2.209 will release soon and add more community-requested features.

The next major content update, either 2.21 or 2.3, is also "actively in development and progressing well."

# Click Between Frames

Geometry Dash 2.208 added the Click Between Frames mod, although it is officially called Click Between / On Steps in-game.

But upon release, this was not the *exact* same as Click Between Frames. While top players noted it allows more precise inputs, the inputs are not as precise as what the Click Between Frames mod could do.

Fortunately, this was fixed in version 2.2081, a small hotfix that was released shortly after the initial release of 2.208. Now, everything appears to work normally!

Regardless, this is a massive development for top play, or even for regular players who want their inputs to feel more precise.

# Leaderboards

After over two years since the release of update 2.2, Geometry Dash 2.208 has added a Moons leaderboard. In addition to Stars, Moons are a primary statistic in Geometry Dash, so this new leaderboard for them is long overdue but a welcome addition.

Update 2.208 also added leaderboards for Demons and User Coins, two other competitive statistics.

# New Gauntlets

Geometry Dash 2.208 added the Random and Chance Gauntlets, two Gauntlets that feature the top 10 winning levels from the Random Gauntlet Contest.

These levels were split into two Gauntlets because Gauntlets can only hold up to five levels each. The easier levels are in the Random Gauntlet and the harder levels are in the Chance Gauntlet.

# Editor Changes

The Geometry Dash editor now has a new trace system. This allows triggers to visually indicate which blocks they affect.

With this previously only being accessible with mods, this is another welcome addition to the Geometry Dash editor.

This update also adds a next free group ID offset, which allows you to offset which IDs appear when requesting the next free one. This is especially useful in collaborations, where creators usually have a set range of IDs they have to work with.

# More Social Media Buttons

Update 2.208 also added the ability to add your Instagram, TikTok and Discord profiles to your Geometry Dash account.

In addition, there is a new "custom" option. This is so that mods can verify your account ownership, such as by asking you to put a code there that they can view. A small but welcome change that no doubt some members of the community will appreciate.

While [Geometry Dash 2.21 was originally predicted to come out sooner](/posts/geometry-dash-2-21-release-date-might-be-this-november/), it turns out RobTop was working on this update instead. But fortunately, RobTop has hinted that in addition to 2.209, the next major content update was in the works. So 2.21 or even 2.3 shouldn't be far away now.

Geometry Dash 2.21 was originally expected to release shortly after the release of the 2.2 update. But after over a year, no news has been released about the Geometry Dash 2.21 update—until now.

# Potential Geometry Dash 2.21 Release Date

On July 18, RobTop Games announced the Random Gauntlet Contest. However, the Gauntlet textures for this contest are not currently in the game. This means that **Geometry Dash 2.21 might release on November 16, 2025.** This means that 2.21 would also include the Gauntlet sprites for the Random Gauntlet Contest.

However, [it is possible for this date to get delayed](/posts/geometry-dash-2-21-release-date-everything-you-need-to-know/). In the past, RobTop has extended contest deadlines to give creators more time. If this happens again, the November 16th update may get delayed with it.

# Upcoming Geometry Dash Features This November

At the very least, we can confirm that an update will come out on or before November 16, 2025 which adds the **Random and Chance Gauntlets,** two new Gauntlets that will feature the top 10 winning levels in the Random Gauntlet Contest.

# Will Geometry Dash 2.21 Release This November?

While it is likely Geometry Dash 2.21 could release this November, it could also be another filler update like 2.208. While this would be disapointing, RobTop has release Geometry Dash 2.21 features early in the past, [such as Event Levels](/posts/all-geometry-dash-event-levels/), which came out in [version 2.207](/posts/geometry-dash-2-207-released-on-steam/).

So even if Geometry Dash 2.21 is delayed, we can guarantee that at the very least update 2.208 will release by the end of the Random Gauntlet Contest. There is also a chance that this update brings along 2.21 features like [a new official level "Explorers"](/posts/geometry-dash-new-sneak-peek-analysis/) and [Versus Mode](/posts/robtop-cancels-geometry-dash-2-2-versus-mode-after-6-years-of-development/).

While RobTop has expressed interest in adding [official multiplayer support](/posts/geometry-dash-multiplayer-how-to-download-and-install/) to Geometry Dash, that will very likely be delayed to an update beyond 2.21 like version 2.3 or 2.4.

But no matter what happens, a new update will release in the next few months. Only time will tell what it brings!

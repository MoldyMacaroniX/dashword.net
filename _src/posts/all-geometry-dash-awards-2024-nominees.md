The Geometry Dash Awards nominees for 2024 have just released, featuring 18 categories and over 100 unique players being nominated for an award. Here is a list containing every nominee for every category in the latest Geometry Dash Awards.

The [Geometry Dash Awards](/posts/geometry-dash-awards-explained-what-are-they/) are a yearly awards show meant to acknowledge the Geometry Dash community's achievements for the year. They feature many different types of players, creators, streamers, and YouTubers that can get nominated for a category. If they win that category, they will receive a badge on their Geometry Dash profile.

While the Awards have been [criticized in the past](/posts/will-the-geometry-dash-awards-be-better-this-year/) for not representing large parts of the Geometry Dash community, I personally found the Awards this year to be a lot better, with many new faces getting nominated. That being said, there are still some creators I would have liked to see get a Best Video nomination, notably [videos on this list](/posts/my-open-letter-to-the-geometry-dash-community/).

Either way, if the Awards keep getting better at this rate, I look forward to seeing what future Awards have to offer! *I promise I'm not saying that just cause I got nominated this year...although that does mean the world to me!*

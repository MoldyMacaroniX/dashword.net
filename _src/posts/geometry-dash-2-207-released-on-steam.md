Geometry Dash 2.207 has been released on Steam and adds Event levels, new achievements, and the Wraith Vault, among other things.

Currently, the update is only available for Windows and Mac devices, but it will release on mobile platforms soon.

# Geometry Dash 2.207 Features

- Event levels and chests!
- New achievements and rewards
- New song trigger options
- Bugfixes and optimizations
- The [Wraith Vault](/posts/geometry-dash-all-wraith-vault-codes/)
- Secrets...

This news comes from the [Geometry Dash Discord server](https://www.dashword.net/posts/geometry-dash-discord-server-how-to-join-request-levels/).

While Event levels were originally planned for [Geometry Dash 2.201](/posts/geometry-dash-2-21-might-be-days-away-new-information-reveals/), it appears RobTop has decided to release it early. This means Geometry Dash 2.201 [could still be months away](/posts/geometry-dash-2-21-release-date-everything-you-need-to-know/) as originally assumed.

Either way, Geometry Dash 2.207 is out and adds a bunch of neat features, [including a new Vault](/posts/geometry-dash-all-vaults-and-secrets-2022/).

The long-awaited Extreme Demon, **Flamewall**, was verified Sunday by top player **Cuatriocientos**, potentially placing at #1 on the [Pointercrate Demon List](https://pointercrate.com/demonlist).

Hosted and uploaded by Narwall, with the help of Valentine and over 100 creators and playtesters, *Flamewall* is considered by many to be one of the most ambitious projects in the game's history. Clocking in at 6 minutes 46 seconds, it holds the world record for the longest verified level projected to be the hardest demon in Geometry Dash.

The [first preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4E9FlJbEGU) of *Flamewall* was uploaded to Narwall's channel on Dec. 30, 2022, showing the first 7 seconds of gameplay (0-1%). The [full layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niToC5o8OEo) was released on Jan. 18, 2023, and the [fully decorated level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5PVPKufjaE) premiered on Sept. 16, using over 400,000 objects. It was originally projected to rank #1-3 on the Demon List at the time of completion.

The original person set to verify *Flamewall* was American player and content creator **[OneAlphaHelix](https://www.youtube.com/@OneAlphaHelix)**, who made very quick progress on the level immediately after it was finished.

On Jan. 21, 2024, OneAlphaHelix [announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uunRwMt-o8) that he was taking an indefinite break from Geometry Dash, hinting at the idea that the physics changes from [Update 2.2](https://www.dashword.net/posts/geometry-dash-2-21-release-date-might-be-this-november/) made top-level play and verifying *Flamewall* too much of a mental challenge. He also announced in the same video that he was dropping *Flamewall* and handing the verification over to Spanish pro player **[Cuatrocientos](https://www.youtube.com/@cuatrocientos400).**

Given that Cuatrocientos was a playtester of the level prior to being the verifier, he made significant progress early on.

Only three days after getting 80%, Cuatrocientos would get the worst death in Geometry Dash history... **[99%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gZEJI-2yQQ)**, crashing only 0.37% before the end of the level.

The [NCS Gauntlet Contest](/posts/robtop-announces-geometry-dash-ncs-gauntlet-contest-with-3500-in-cash-prizes/) has seen many entries, but the first [NCS Mythic level](/posts/ncs-added-to-geometry-dash-music-library/) is Next Cab Soon by Geogamer12 and more.

This makes Next Cab Soon the seventh Mythic level ever, the third classic mythic level, first Mythic NCS level, and first mythic weekly demon. This also makes Geogamer12 the first creator to have two mythic levels.

Fresh off the back of [Rage Quit by Bli](/posts/rage-quit-by-bli-becomes-first-easy-mythic-level-in-geometry-dash/), RobTop has rewarded Geogamer12 with his second mythic level. This also makes it a surprise that Next Cab Soon was [started and finished within a month](https://youtu.be/-49I4WjHrys?si=GG7FXt-JvhNS7kw8).

# Next Cab Soon Reviews

Many Geometry Dash players have mixed opinions on Next Cab Soon. Some community members are saying that this level might not deserve the Mythic rating it received.

One community member [said the following](https://www.reddit.com/r/geometrydash/comments/1fskidz/comment/lpllvr4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button):

> It looks really clean but I’ve spent over an hour with it and its visuals are all I can give it credit for. I don’t like the gameplay, the coin, while somewhat creative, isn’t worth going for and overall it fails to leave a lasting impression on me.

Many players are expressing concern with the level's gameplay, saying the team focused too much on decoration at the cost of gameplay. And while many players are calling the coin very creative, many admit that they do not believe it to be worth going for.

Considering that the NCS Gauntlet Contest is partly a promotion for NoCopyrightSounds, it makes sense for at least one entry to get rated Mythic.

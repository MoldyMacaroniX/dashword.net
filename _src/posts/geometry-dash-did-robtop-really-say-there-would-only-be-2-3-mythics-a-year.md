While RobTop never gave an exact estimate, he did say there would be "Godlike" (the original name for "Mythic") levels "a few times a year," which is likely where the false recollection comes from.

RobTop started by saying Godlike levels will almost never happen:

![yea well godlike will almost never happen BUT](https://i.imgur.com/KEpe1v1.png)

However, he quickly gave a rough estimate of "a few times a year."

![its fun if it happens a few times a year](https://i.imgur.com/ehTlf4f.png)

He has also said that "a few levels a year" will get Godlike:

![if a few levels a year get godlike I dont think the 5 creator points will matter](https://i.imgur.com/a8CndAp.png)

So while RobTop never gave an exact estimate close to "2-3 levels a year," he did hint that Mythic levels would be relatively uncommon.

It is worth noting that these statements are from four years before 2.2 released. But if RobTop did change his mind between then and the release of 2.2, he didn't make it clear.

Currently, we're on track to get about a dozen Mythic levels per year. While not a lot, it could still be argued this is more than what RobTop initially thought.

And RobTop has since spoke out about this, admitting that he initially thought there would be less Mythics.

So, while the Geometry Dash community's recollection that RobTop said "2-3 times a year" is false, it is true that RobTop did expect there to be less Mythic levels.

But who says more Mythic levels is a bad thing? No matter whether or not you think a specific level deserves or doesn't deserve the Mythic rating, the fact that there are more Mythics than we thought prove that this community is continuing to revolutionize this simple 2D platformer, even after 11 years.

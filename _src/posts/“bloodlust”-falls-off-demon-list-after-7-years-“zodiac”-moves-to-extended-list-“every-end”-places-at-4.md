The Geometry Dash community experienced a major shift Sunday as three former top 1 demons "[Bloodlust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZlRHWuVDn4)," "[Zodiac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCQK_y8JutU&pp=ygUJem9kaWFjIGdk)" and "[Kenos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfwUCuC6Z2I&pp=ygUIa2Vub3MgNGvSBwkJfgkBhyohjO8%3D)" fell out of the top 150 and 75 hardest levels, respectively, on the [Pointercrate Demon List](https://pointercrate.com/demonlist).

These changes are due to the recent addition of "[Every End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KexrBfBCZJA)" — a new Extreme Demon created by MindCap and more — being placed at **\#4** on the Demon List, ending the levels' **7-year-long** reign.

To understand the significance of these changes, it is important to look at the history of the levels that were affected.

**"Bloodlust**,**"** a mega-collaboration hosted by [Manix648](https://www.youtube.com/@manix648), is a harder, updated version of the most popular Extreme Demon in Geometry Dash history, “[Bloodbath](https://www.dashword.net/posts/geometry-dash-level-bloodbath-reaches-50-million-downloads/)” by [Riot](https://www.youtube.com/@Riottt) and others, featuring new decoration and an extended ending. The level was originally intended for verification by [Quasar](https://www.youtube.com/@GDQuasar) — the [first victor of Bloodbath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlvdGvFCmr8) — however, he dropped it due to hand pain. Bloodlust was later handed over to pro player [Knobbelboy](https://www.youtube.com/@knobbelboy), and he [verified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SzKetF2btw) the level on Feb. 20, 2018, after 120,000 attempts and over 18 months of play. It held the Demonlist's top spot for 13 months until “[Zodiac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCQK_y8JutU)“ by Bianox and more dethroned it on March 9, 2019.

**"Zodiac"** is a mega-collaboration initially hosted by [RicoLP](https://www.youtube.com/@ricolp_gd) and later transferred to [Bianox](https://www.youtube.com/@BIANOX). The level was [first previewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV_0xfYdXRY) on July 15, 2017 and was [completed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnvmoftF5Zc) after 7 months on Feb. 12, 2018, with top player [Wooshi](https://www.youtube.com/@Wooshi999) initially set to verify it. The verifier would be changed 4 different times until Xander completed it on Jan. 29, 2019, after 61,375 attempts. However, Xander later confessed to hack-verifying the level, meaning the first person who beat it legitimately was technically the new “verifier”. That player would end up being [Technical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4QjElo58_o), who completed it on April 9, 2019. The level placed at #1 on the Demonlist and sat at the top spot for nearly a year, until it was finally overtaken by “[Tartarus](https://www.dashword.net/posts/geometry-dash-tartarus-falls-from-top-10-after-2-years/)” on Feb. 11, 2020.

**"Kenos"** is another mega-collaboration hosted by Bianox, acting as a buffed and re-decorated version of the classic, former Top 1 Extreme Demon, "[Sakupen Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svyOjwLCErg)" by Noobas. The level was [first showcased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJy3Wk6zIQI) on December 6, 2016 during the 2.0 update, showcasing the beginning extension with new decoration. The level was officially [completed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN2CuONldSM) a year and a half later on April 29, 2018, and the first verification attempt was given to [ChiefFlurry](https://www.youtube.com/@ChiefFlurry). However, before the level was finished, it was passed on to [Combined](https://www.youtube.com/@CombinedGS), who made exceptional progress, including [71%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p326x093gSo), [90%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U2Q8_y7j-s) and eventually getting his worst fail at [97%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGh6n2dL46c) twice. He went on to [buff the level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhqKwDXxASw), and progress slowed down enough to where the host Bianox passed the level on to the player [Crazen](https://geometry-dash-fan.fandom.com/wiki/Crazen). After getting 34%, he dropped the level quick into his verification attempt, and Kenos was then given to [Miro](https://www.youtube.com/@Miro03). He managed to reach [70%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rfq9R3AE1c), but unfortunately was unable to complete it either. Then it was moved over to [npesta](https://www.youtube.com/@npesta), who was finally the one to [verify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs1kVySdUtI) Kenos on December 14, 2019, after 135,320 attempts and 117 live-streams on his YouTube channel. The level just barely missed out on the title of the hardest demon, placing at #2 on the Demonlist behind Zodiac. However, over 5 years later on March 7, 2025, Kenos was finally moved from #70 to #69, now placing above Zodiac, meaning the level was technically the hardest demon in Geometry Dash following its verification.

**"Every End"** is a 7+ minute mega-collaboration hosted by MindCap, known for its exclusive use of the cube gamemode and 1.0 update decorations. The level went through a few different verifiers — including [BGram](https://www.youtube.com/@BGram) and [ViperVenom95](https://www.youtube.com/@vipervenom9556) — but both dropped the level. Ultimately, Every End was picked up by [Hqmy](https://www.youtube.com/@HamiltonHqmy), who successfully [verified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KexrBfBCZJA) it after 29,890 attempts.

The official [Demonlist account on X](https://x.com/demonlistgd) (formerly known as Twitter), made these posts on April 20 regarding the placement of Every End:

> Every End has been placed at #4, below BOOBAWAMBA and above andromeda, with a list requirement of 67%. **Zodiac** has been pushed into the Extended List and **Bloodlust** has been pushed off from the Demon List.

> Checked Steam has been raised from #78 to #69, above Critical Heat and below Terminal Rampancy, with a list requirement of 70%. This pushes **Kenos** to the extended list after over 5 years.

**Technical**, verifier of Zodiac, expressed his feelings on the list changes in the official [Demonlist Discord server](https://discord.gg/demonlist), stating:

> It really is insane to me how much Zodiac has stood the test of time. Over 6 years on the Main List... I unknowingly verified that level when I was 15 years old. I turned 22 two days ago. Even though it will still remain on the list for players to challenge themselves, I can't help but realize that this is truly the start of a new era, especially considering what level has also fallen today. The explosion in skill that this game has seen over the last few years has been nothing short of incredible and surreal to witness and I can't wait to see how far it goes.

These changes to the Demonlist highlight the true dynamic nature of Geometry Dash. The constant new achievements players make have reshaped the competitive landscape in ways that the community never believed to be possible, even just a few years ago.

As these players continue to create and conquer increasingly difficult levels, the community will continue to redefine what the "*pinnacle of difficulty*" is in this game, and we will become even closer to reaching the coveted **human skill ceiling.**

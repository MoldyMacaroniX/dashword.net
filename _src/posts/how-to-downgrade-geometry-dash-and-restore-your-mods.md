With the release of Geometry Dash 2.207, all mods have stopped working. Fortunately, you can downgrade to Geometry Dash 2.206 to restore your mods.

Before doing anything, [backup your save data](/posts/backup-gd-data-steam/)! This way you can restore it if anything goes wrong.

# How to Downgrade Geometry Dash to 2.206

First, backup your save data. Then, follow these steps to downgrade Geometry Dash to 2.206 so you can restore your mods:

1. Open [steam://nav/console](steam://nav/console) in your browser
2. Enter `download_depot 322170 322171 7903404280228366327` into the console. This only works on Windows. This will take a while to download!
3. Go to `Program Files (x86)` > `steam` > `steamapps` > `content` > `app_322170`
4. Copy the folder called `depot_322171` and paste it in `steamapps` > `common`
5. Rename your Geometry Dash folder to something else and rename `depot_322171` to `Geometry Dash`
6. Reinstall all your mods

You will have to reinstall all your mods, but your save data should be intact. That being said, it is still a good idea to back it up before following these steps!

After getting into Geometry Dash, popular streamer Jynxzi has completed Clubstep, the first official demon level in Geometry Dash, as his first demon.

Jynxzi began getting into Geometry Dash several weeks ago. But on November 3, 2025, [he received coaching](https://www.youtube.com/live/HFLYip2FiiU) from the current best Geometry Dash player, Zoink.

Two weeks later on November 22, 2025, Jynxzi has beaten his [first ever demon level](https://www.youtube.com/live/kUdkpJ8OHfw), Clubstep. This feat took him 3,620 attempts.

While Clubstep is the first official demon level in Geometry Dash, it is not the easiest demon. [There are many online levels that are considered easier](/posts/10-easiest-geometry-dash-demons-to-get-100-free-stars/), so Clubstep being Jynxzi's first ever demon is an incredible feat for someone who has only been playing for a short while.

For how much longer Jynxzi will continue playing Geometry Dash is unknown, but regardless of what happens, Jynxzi can officially say he has beaten a Geometry Dash demon level.

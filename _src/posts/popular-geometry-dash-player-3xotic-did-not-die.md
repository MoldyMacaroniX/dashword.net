In 2015, the former top Geometry Dash player "3xotiC" abruptly disappeared. A few days later, he tweeted on his Twitter account and claimed he had a virus on his body and would die. However, this has since been proven to be a hoax.

But in 2025, new research has come out about 3xotiC. Research conducted by SeptaGon7, Remy, Luneye, Ender, and others, have revealed the full story of 3xotiC. Their research has been documented [in an 3xotiC documentary](https://youtu.be/wIxIbc10J8Y?si=s9nX8loGYEZ6A29F) by Stormfly and others.

# 3xotiC Did Not Die

Their research reveals that 3xotiC did not die. Instead, his infamous tweet was a hoax. In reality, 3xotiC merely quit the game.

This was found due to contacting a former friend of 3xotiC. They revealed that 3xotiC did not die. Rather, 3xotiC is likely still alive.

# Why 3xotiC Quit Geometry Dash

3xotiC likely quit the game due to getting banned. Research into 3xotiC's stats have revealed that he was very likely cheating. Once Geometry Dash 2.0 released in 2015, Geometry Dash's improved anticheat system detected him as a hacker, and therefore banned him.

But around the time when he was banned, 3xotiC changed his name to "Extincti0n." This is also why he appeared to vanish, because nobody knew his new username.

However, these achievements have also been deemed as cheated.

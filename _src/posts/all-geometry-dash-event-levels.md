# First Event Level

The first Event Level is Back on Dash by AudieoVisual. It kickstarted the NCS Album, which subsequent Event Levels would be made for. It is rated Epic.

Citadel by Serponge was also the first Event Level to be rated Legendary and Button Masher by Viprin and more was the first Event level to be rated Mythic.

Heave Ho by Magpipe was also the first Event Level to not be made for the Geometry Dash and NCS collaboration.

GD GANGSTER RAP was the first April Fools event level. It is also not only BoomKitty's first rated level, but his first Mythic level.

# How to beat Event Levels

Event Levels are designed by talented Geometry Dash creators but can still feature some tricky gameplay. In particular, Backstreet Boy by Zoroa is known to have some tricky parts.

The best way to Beat Event levels are to play them in practice mode a few times. Event Levels can be hard to beat in one attempt due to flashy visuals, but after learning the entire levels, they should be a breeze to go through.

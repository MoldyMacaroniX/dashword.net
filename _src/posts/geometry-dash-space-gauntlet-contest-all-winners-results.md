With the release of 2.2 nearly reaching its 1.5-year anniversary, the Geometry Dash community has already pushed the limits of what was believed to be possible with the editor, creating some of the most cinematic and jaw-dropping levels of all time.

In the process, some hidden figures in the creating scene have made their mark thanks to the Space Gauntlet, earning the long-overdue recognition they deserve. Massive props to everyone who participated in this event, and congratulations to the winners!

With up to $1000 available for the top spot, masterpieces were submitted to this contest. With this resulting in three [new Mythic levels](/posts/rage-quit-by-bli-becomes-first-easy-mythic-level-in-geometry-dash/), [Next Cab Soon](/posts/ncs-mythic-level-next-cab-soon-becomes-7th-mythic-in-geometry-dash/), BER ZER KER, and WANNACRY, the NCS Gauntlet Contest has been one of the best events Geometry Dash has ever seen.

[Geometry Dash update 2.2](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-released/) has only been out for less than a year, but we've already seen some of the best levels ever made in this indie mobile game by RobTop Games. Not to mention an official collaboration with NCS.

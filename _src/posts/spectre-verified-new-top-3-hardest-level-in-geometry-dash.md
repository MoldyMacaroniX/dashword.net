The Geometry Dash community celebrates as Australian pro player PersonHuman42 verifies the new potentially 3rd hardest level, "Spectre."




PersonHuman42, ranked #35 on the Pointercrate Demonlist Stats Viewer, completed the level by xander556 on October 5 after 106,017 attempts and over three months.




Spectre is inspired by the popular level "Zodiac"—also created by xander556—which was once the hardest level in the game from March 2019 to February 2020, when it was dethroned by former impossible level "Tartarus" by Riot and more.




Xander556 released the full layout for Spectre in August 2020, and the fully decorated level was not showcased until February 2024. The level was originally set to be verified by Ezvie, but they unfortunately had to drop the project. PersonHuman42 was then selected to complete the verification process in June 2024.




"This level is absolutely fantastic," PersonHuman42 said in the description of his verification video. "I was following this level for years, since it was still in the layout phase, and I knew I'd want to do it one day. Fast forward to December last year…Xander joined the stream and asked if I wanted to playtest, which I of course did. Then in June, I was offered to verify, which again, of course I did. Being able to get a level I already thought was good, and subject it to my own high standards of playtesting, was an incredible experience."




After only 24 hours, PersonHuman42 has not only gained over 1,000 subscribers and 75,000 views, but the verification has solidified his spot in Geometry Dash history for years to come.




Spectre is currently the highest unrated level on the Trending page, with over 17,000 downloads as of October 6. The level is likely to be featured within the upcoming days.


While Spectre is not yet placed on the Demonlist, PersonHuman42 states that the level is expected to be "around Acheron (#2) difficulty" and "way harder than Firework (#12)." As more victors of the level appear in the upcoming months, this is highly subject to change.

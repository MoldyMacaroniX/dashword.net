Dashword has surpassed 10,000 monthly readers, furthering its reign as the top Geometry Dash news source on the web.

As with all things, [we just cannot thank you enough](/posts/dashword-has-surpassed-6000-monthly-readers/)!

Dashword, from the start, [has always been an open-source publication](/about/). Anyone can contribute content to the website or help make the site better from behind the scenes.

Whether you just fixed a silly typo on a page or wrote a [thousand word essay to share with our readers](/posts/killbot-aging-legend/), we thank all of our contributors very much!

We also thank you, dear reader, for reading our content.

Going forward, we will continue to produce reliable, high quality news on all things Geometry Dash for new and old players alike.

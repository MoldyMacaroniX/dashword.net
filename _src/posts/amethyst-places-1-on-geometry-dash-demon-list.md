The former hardest level in Geometry Dash, Tidal Wave, has been dethroned by Amethyst after it was verified by wPopoff on May 24, 2025.

Amethyst is a level created by Bedrock and more to take the top 1 spot on the [Geometry Dash Demon List](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-where-to-find-the-hardest-demons/). After changing hands between verifiers, wPopoff was the one to finish it off.

# Amethyst vs Thinking Space 2

Amethyst was also verified on the same day as Zoink verified Thinking Space 2. Unfortunately, Thinking Space 2 [has yet to be rated](/posts/rate-standards/) and placed on the Demon List.

Whether or not Thinking Space 2 is harder than Amethyst is yet to be seen. Only once Thinking Space 2 is rated and placed on the Demon List will we learn which is harder.

# Grief Could Beat Amethyst

[Grief](/posts/geometry-dash-slaughterhouse-sequel-grief-verified-and-set-to-be-verified-by-doggie/) is another upcoming top 1 verification in the works. Whether or not it places above Amethyst and Thinking Space 2 is unknown at this point in time.

While Doggie has been working hard to verify it, he is choosing to do so with [Click Between Frames](/posts/geometry-dash-click-between-frames-mod-download-and-install/), a controversial mod banned by the Geometry Dash developers but allowed on the Demon List.

However, levels need to be rated in order to be included on the Pointercrate Demon List, the most popular Demon List. So while Demon List completions are allowed to use Click Between Frames, there is no guarantee that Grief will get rated if it is verified using it.

Fortunately, the Demon List staff have suggested allowing unrated levels on the Demon List. Only time will tell what the fate of Grief is and if it will overthrow Amethyst.

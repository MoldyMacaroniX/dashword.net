If you've ever tried to make a featured level in Geometry Dash, you might be confused as to why your levels aren't getting noticed. Fortunately, there is a science to getting your levels featured in Geometry Dash that we hope to share with you here.

In Geometry Dash, there are three ratings a level can get: a regular star rating, a featured rating, and an epic rating. A regular star rating rewards one creator point, a featured rating rewards two, and an epic rating rewards three.

If a level is worthy of a rating, what it gets is hand-picked by the developer, [RobTop Games](/posts/robtop-confirms-geometry-dash-2-3-will-come-out-6-months-from-when-he-starts/). Fortunately, a featured rating is by far the most common rating levels seen by RobTop obtain.

This guide will go over [how to make a feature worthy level](/posts/5-tips-to-get-your-first-featured-level-in-geometry-dash/) and get it noticed by RobTop.

# Making Feature Worthy Gameplay

The biggest factor that makes a level feature worthy over just star rate worthy is **good gameplay**. Gameplay is how the level plays without decoration.

Having fun gameplay is essential to a level being well received. If people don't enjoy playing your level, [then it is less likely to be noticed by RobTop](/posts/geometry-dash-levels-how-to-make-a-featured-level-2022/).

There are two ways to go about making gameplay for your level: you can make the entire gameplay before decorating it, or you can build gameplay and decorate at the same time.

We recommend building gameplay in "parts." After building a part of gameplay, decorate it, and repeat.

While there is no one way to make gameplay, we recommend organizing it into parts. We also suggest that you make your gameplay meet the following guidelines:

- Have each part only use one game mode
- Have a part featuring [every game mode in the game](/posts/full-history-of-geometry-dash-gamemodes-1-0-2-2/)
- Have each part be around 10-20 seconds long
- Have the full level be at least 60 seconds long
- Make sure all gameplay is able to be seen at a distance and not hidden offscreen

If your level meets all of the above criteria, you are well on your way to making a feature worthy level.

# Making Feature Worthy Decoration

Making gameplay is unfortunately only half the battle. Now, we need to start the much longer **decoration** process.

In a featured level, the decoration usually consists of block design, ground spikes, air decoration, and a custom background.

See if you can point out these four design elements in the level below!

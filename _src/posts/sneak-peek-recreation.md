The Geometry Dash 2.2 sneak peek astonished everybody. While some are more fond of it than others, it is safe to say that it will revolutionize the game when it comes out with update 2.2. However, like what creators did in updates prior, they made countless remakes of the sneak peek — some better than others.

Arguably the best of the remakes is [Sneak Peek Playable](https://gdpseditor.gdbrowser.com/116051) by [ShruGGie](https://gdpseditor.gdbrowser.com/u/ShruGGie), [Drren](https://gdpseditor.gdbrowser.com/u/drren), [Pandora](https://gdpseditor.gdbrowser.com/u/pandora), and Nitanchik on the [GDPS Editor 2.2](https://gdpseditor.gdbrowser.com/) private server. RobTop himself even [commented on my video](https://youtu.be/97-3-NAA_ZM) about it, saying...

> This is insane

And, it *is* insane. Just [look at it]()! It's practically an exact replica! So, how did they remake it without actual 2.2 features? Well, when I share with you the methods used it will make the remake seem even more insane than it already is.

If you work best with video, consider checking out the [video I made]() on the topic.

# GDPS Editor 2.2

While I did say they remade it "without actual 2.2 features," that isn't entirely true. While still missing a lot of necessary features, the team had access to a few via the GDPS Editor 2.2 (also known as the Blaze GDPS) private server, as described earlier. However, even with the help of these features, they are still not enough on their own.

# The Arrow Trigger

The arrow trigger is a trigger which changes the direction of the player to allow gameplay to go in directions not previously possible, such as up walls. In the 2.2 sneak peek, this is used on numerous occasions.

This was recreated by making two identical parts, rotating one of them, and teleporting the player between them. This combined with some camera rotation makes a seamless arrow trigger illusion.

# The Pixel Art

Geometry Dash starts to break when levels involve extreme and dense object counts. Unfortunately, that is exactly what pixel art is. But nevertheless, the creators of the 1:1 recreation remade every pixel design from the sneak peek, causing the level to be incredibly unstable. This would cause frequent crashes throughout the rest of the building process.

# The Animations

Geometry Dash 2.2 adds a lot of new [animations](https://www.twitch.tv/robtopgames/clip/PolitePiercingElephantUncleNox), many of which are used in the sneak peek. These were recreated by tracing every frame of each animation, which is no doubt a lot of work.

# Bugs

As comes with an incredibly unstable level, the recreation so far had a lot of bugs. For example, a layering issue caused some pixel art to break. However, due to the level being so unstable, it was impossible to open on mobile. With this, it had to be finished on an emulator.

# Release

After the level was finished, it was released on the GDPS Editor 2.2 private server. I believe this level is a demonstration on how far this community has come creation-wise. 2.2 is not even out yet but we have already recreated the sneak peek, 1:1 scale. These are things no other community is capable of, so for that reason it becomes clear the Geometry Dash community is unlike any other.

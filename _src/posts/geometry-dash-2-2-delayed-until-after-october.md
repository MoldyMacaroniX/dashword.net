On August 13, RobTop Games revealed the release date for [Geometry Dash 2.2](/categories/2.2/) to be [October 2023](/posts/final-geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-confirmed-by-robtop/). However, [as we feared](/posts/geometry-dash-2-2-release-date-might-get-delayed-to-after-october/), it is November and update 2.2 is still not out.

This is somewhat surprising, as RobTop kept [delaying](/posts/explorers-delayed-until-after-geometry-dash-2-2/) [features](/posts/robtop-cancels-geometry-dash-2-2-versus-mode-after-6-years-of-development/) from releasing in 2.2 supposedly so he could release the update in time.

There is no new release date yet, but there is still a chance Geometry Dash 2.2 releases before the end of the year.

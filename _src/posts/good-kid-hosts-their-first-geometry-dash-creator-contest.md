The Geometry Dash community is getting another creative challenge, this time with an indie/rock twist. Indie rock band **Good Kid** has officially announced a **Geometry Dash Level Contest**, inviting creators to build Classic-mode levels using Good Kid’s music. The contest celebrates the band's growing presence in rhythm-game spaces and the long-standing crossover between Geometry Dash creators and music-driven gameplay.

# The Challenge

Creators are asked to design a **Classic-mode Geometry Dash level** using one or more Good Kid tracks. Submissions will be judged on creativity (decoration, overall presentation), gameplay (consistency, difficulty balance, enjoyability), and song usage (sync, creativity, interpretation). Judges include Jacob and David (guitarists from Good Kid), alongside Geometry Dash creators **Colon**, **Moldy**, **GeoBlitzy**, **Herozer**, **Juniper**, **Arclia**, **Vegtam,** and **Jud**.


The contest is open to all skill levels, whether you're a veteran creator or jumping into your first serious build.

# Prizes & Rewards

To spotlight as many creators as possible, Good Kid expanded the prize pool beyond the usual top placements:

- **Top 1: $500 + Free tickets to a Good Kid show near you**
- **Top 2: $250 + Vinyl of Good Kid’s upcoming album**
- **Top 3: $125 + T-shirt from the most recent merch line**
- **Places 4-10** will each earn **$50**
- **Top 25 creators** will be featured in an **official Good Kid video on their channel**

This structure gives more builders a chance to be seen, not just the very top finishers. All info can be found on the dedicated [landing page](https://goodkid.info/gd-contest) and in the [announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7lOov23rgM).

# Why Good Kid?


Good Kid's music has become increasingly popular within rhythm-game communities, with tracks frequently appearing in custom levels and edits across **Geometry Dash** and beyond. The band's music has previously been featured in **Daily Levels**, making this contest feel like a natural next step.



# Where to Join


All contest details, updates, and submissions are being handled through a **[dedicated Discord server](https://discord.gg/2uJRqu3M)** created specifically for challenges like this one, keeping things organized and creator-focused.


If you've ever wanted your Geometry Dash level featured by an official artist, or just want an excuse to build something fun, this contest might be your sign.


Good luck, and happy building!

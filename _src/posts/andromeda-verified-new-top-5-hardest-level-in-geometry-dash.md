The Geometry Dash community is introduced to a new level following the recent placement of "Andromeda" at #5 on the [Pointercrate Demon List](https://pointercrate.com/demonlist).




Created by Insxne97, "Andromeda" was first previewed as a layout on June 2, 2023, with the [full level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6AtXBFbFdg) showcased on June 27. The [first decoration preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df0mThC-se8), an early version of the predrop, was released October 14, 2024. After a year of development, which included multiple updates and revisions, the level was [completed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqQNv-Puq44) on October 20, 2024, ready for verification.




The verification process did not come without roadblocks. Initial verifiers, including **Blackhole 1175** (ranked #217 on the [Demon List Stats Viewer](https://pointercrate.com/demonlist/statsviewer/)), **SurroundedGD** (#238), and **Yossarian** (#6 on the [Challenge List](https://challengelist.gd/challenges/)), all dropped the project. **Taiago**, currently ranked #6 on the Demon List Stats Viewer and a 2023 [Geometry Dash Awards](/posts/geometry-dash-awards-explained-what-are-they/) nominee, took on the level and saw significant progress.




He uploaded a [47% and 52-100%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuA31iWXK44) progress video December 19, 2024, estimating the level would place between 10-15 on the Demonlist. He achieved a [72%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXpbXJfnx8) run 8 days later on December 27, and reached [85%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIH7VsDeGYo) on January 9, 2025. Taiago stated that the 85% run, which was on a version where he "buffed some stuff compared to last video but also balanced it a bit better," was harder than [Tunnel of Despair](/posts/geometry-dash-top-10-hardest-demon-tunnel-of-despair-verified/), the 8th hardest level at the time.




Taiago [verified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk3TDemdkC0) "Andromeda" on Jan. 19, 2025, after 56,637 attempts. In the description of his verification video, he said, "Thank you [@Insxne97](https://www.youtube.com/@Insxne97) for giving me a chance to verify this level, and thanks to everyone else involved in the project...I think I did a good job balancing the level, everything feels consistent and I don't think there are any huge chokepoints."




Despite its verification and rating on Geometry Dash servers, the level still remained relatively unknown. In its first month, the verification video garnered only 22,030 views, the third-lowest among the top 20 hardest levels.




Now after its placement at #5 on the Demon List on March 13, the level's popularity has started gaining traction. In the 48 hours following the Demon List placement, the verification video has gained over 10,000 views. This placement has also shifted the Demon List rankings, knocking "[Acheron](/posts/breaking-acheron-takes-1-spot-on-geometry-dash-demonlist/)" out of the top 5 and "[Tartarus](/posts/geometry-dash-tartarus-falls-from-top-10-after-2-years/)" out of the top 50 after more than 5 years.

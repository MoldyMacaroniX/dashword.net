# How to get Geode for Geometry Dash 2.206

Installing Geode for Geometry Dash 2.207 is the same as its always been, just for the new Geometry Dash version:

1. [Download Geode](https://geode-sdk.org/install) for your device
2. Run the installer you just downloaded
3. Open Geometry Dash and press the new Geode button to install mods


If the installer tells you to, you may need to delete some `.dll` files from your game files. This is because Geode does not support other mod loaders.

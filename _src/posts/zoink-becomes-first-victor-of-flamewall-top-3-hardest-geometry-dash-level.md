After a 99% fail, Zoink has become the first victor of Flamewall, the top three hardest demon in Geometry Dash. This makes him the second player to ever beat this level, with the first being the verifier, Cuatrocientos.

While originally meant to be the hardest extreme demon in Geometry Dash, that never came to be. Because [after being verified](/posts/flamewall-verified-new-top-1-hardest-demon-geometry-dash/) on September 21, Flamewall was placed at the top three spot of the [Geometry Dash Demon List](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-where-to-find-the-hardest-demons/) on October 24.

Despite not being the hardest level in the game, Flamewall went on to get a lot of recognition, with it being praised for its quality decoration and amazing music choice.

# Zoink Becomes First Victor of Flamewall

Zoink began practicing Flamewall only [days after it was verified](https://www.youtube.com/live/laIjc0oHBBk). A few weeks later on November 5, he began [streaming attempts](https://www.youtube.com/live/Arvz3zBFGk4) of Flamewall.

But with Flamewall being a nearly [7 minute long](https://youtu.be/wZbqwUv5NI8) behemoth, Zoink was not in for an easy ride.

But after [63 hours](https://x.com/gdzoink/status/1996712990708847036) of time spent playing the level and a [99% fail](https://youtu.be/4HIDQPlRP6k), Zoink finally beat Flamewall on December 4 after 11,745 attempts.

Zoink has stated that he plans to release a video about his achievement [in two weeks](https://x.com/gdzoink/status/1996715590564929837), likely because he wants to make it bigger than a typical level showcase. Regardless, Zoink has become the first victor of Flamewall, although that may not be so surprising when you consider he is the current [best player in the game](https://pointercrate.com/demonlist/statsviewer/?player=53408).

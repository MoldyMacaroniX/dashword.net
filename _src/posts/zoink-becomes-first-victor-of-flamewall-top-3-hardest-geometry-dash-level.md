After a 99% fail, Zoink has become the first victor of Flamewall, the top three hardest demon in Geometry Dash. This makes him the second player to ever beat this level, with the first being the verifier, Cuatrocientos.

After being verified on September 21, Flamewall was placed on the top three spot of the [Geometry Dash Demon List](/posts/geometry-dash-demon-list-where-to-find-the-hardest-demons/) on October 24.

But with [63 hours](https://x.com/gdzoink/status/1996712990708847036) of time spent playing the level and a 99% fail, Zoink finally beat Flamewall on December 4 after 11,745 attempts.

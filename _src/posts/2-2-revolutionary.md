<!-- ## A source about this article

Will Geometry Dash update 2.2 be **game changing?** The answer to this question is also stated in this video by me: [website] (https://youtu.be/o1E3EHlrHnQ). 

## Main Reason -->

Geometry Dash 2.2 will be a revolutionary update because of the game-changing features being added, including the new camera controls, swing copter, and platformer mode. This will allow the community to experience new content, allowing them to play and build new levels.

# The Community

Geometry Dash's player count will increase even more and gain attraction from new and old players. This will challenge all players to become the *best* in their niche. Only time will tell who that will be. Here is the game's player count from 2015 to early 2022.

# The Editor

Creating will also be a crucial part of the game that will change because of the new editor features being added, like platformer mode and the random trigger. These new features will jumpstart our minds into considering not only what is possible in the new update, but in all future updates down the line.

# The Unlikely Possibility

What if the update isn't revolutionary? Will the community die? Will RopTop make more updates? As I said, this is very unlikely and will probably never happen, but if it did, the majority of the community would quit and regret waiting for the update out of frustration and sadness. The game would be dead after the impact of this.

# Conclusion

This article is based on the following video I made about the topic.

In conclusion, Geometry Dash update 2.2 will be revolutionary and will bring joy to the community after a long five years of waiting.

Slaughterhouse is one of the most popular levels in Geometry Dash. It has a long history and is one of the infamous extreme demons in the game. On the 9th of April 2022, TheZinkYT, a former Geometry Dash Demon List Moderator, raided a Getting Over It streamer on Twitch named GFMBadger.

TheZinkYT asked GFMBadger "what does Geometry Dash look like today?" GFMBadger decided to watch a Slaughterhouse completion video on stream, during which he reacted to IcEDCave's part (from 18-49%) with visible amazement. He also jokingly asked "are these spikes in the dark" whilst reacting to the hardest level.

On April 11, the clip of GFMBadger reacting to Slaughterhouse would be re-posted by TheZinkYT himself on his Twitter. The tweet gained over 1500 likes! Shortly after the tweet went viral, GFMBadger jokingly said that he will need to do a Geometry Dash stream, but he never ended up getting the time to play the game.

However, this isn't the first time a non-GD player has looked at a hard level from the game.

Geometry Dash players looking at their home pages on YouTube probably know the Geometry Dash YouTuber EidamGD. He went viral after posting the first ever "non-GD players rank and react to Extreme Demons" video.

This later became a YouTube trend where non-GD players would be tested on, rank, and react to Geometry Dash topics.

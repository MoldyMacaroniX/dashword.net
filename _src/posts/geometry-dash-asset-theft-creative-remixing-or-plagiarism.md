Asset stealing seems to be the brand new hot topic in the Geometry Dash community, specifically on Twitter. Nasgubb, a popular creator, [gave his take]() on the matter after the famous level [Natural Disaster was unrated](/posts/geometry-dash-extreme-demon-natural-disaster-unrated-following-accusations/) for stealing assets.

But let's be real. One major reason this controversy is so, well, *controversial*, is likely because nobody really agrees on what asset theft even is.

In this article, I will define **asset theft** as so:

> Directly copying and pasting an entire unaltered design from another level into your own.

This *will not* be the same as **asset inspiration**:

> Remaking a design from another level for use in your own level. It may look very similar but won't be identical because it wasn't directly copied and pasted.

With this out of the way, there's only one question that remains: Is "asset theft" a means of creative remixing, or an unethical form of plagiarism?

Geometry Dash demon keys are used to unlock treasure chests from the [treasure room](/posts/geometry-dash-all-vaults-and-secrets-2022/#treasure-room), but how to obtain them is a little confusing at first.

You get one demon key for every 500 [mana orbs](/posts/geometry-dash-how-to-get-mana-orbs-easy/) you collect, **excluding** mana orbs from daily chests and treasure chests. This means that mana orbs only count towards demon keys [if you get them from a rated level](/posts/geometry-dash-how-to-get-mana-orbs-easy/#complete-levels) (excluding auto levels).

Fortunately, there are some simple techniques to easily get mana orbs from levels and collect demon keys.

* [Demon Levels](#demon-levels)
* [Choose Your Own Difficulty](#choose-your-own-difficulty)

# Demon Levels

A demon level rewards 500 mana orbs upon completion, which is enough to get a demon key. However, you don't need to actually beat a level to collect all the mana orbs it has to offer! In fact, 80% of a level's mana orbs are rewarded without even completing the level.

So, if you get 50% on a level, you are still getting a lot of mana orbs.

Simply play demons and get a good percent. You don't have to beat it, as you can get lots of mana orbs just by increasing your percent.

# Choose Your Own Difficulty

Unfortunately, demon levels are the hardest levels in the game, so even getting a high score like 50% can be very challenging.

Fortunately, all rated levels (excluding auto levels) have mana orbs to offer, not just demons! Although, how much mana orbs a level has to offer depends on its difficulty.

* **Auto 1 star** levels reward **0** mana orbs.
* **Easy 2 star** levels reward **50** mana orbs.
* **Normal 3 star** levels reward **75** mana orbs.
* **Hard 4 star** levels reward **125** mana orbs.
* **Hard 5 star** levels reward **175** mana orbs.
* **Harder 6 star** levels reward **225** mana orbs.
* **Harder 7 star** levels reward **275** mana orbs.
* **Insane 8 star** levels reward **350** mana orbs.
* **Insane 9 star** levels reward **425** mana orbs.
* **Demon 10 star** levels reward **500** mana orbs.

So, figure out the highest difficulty you are able to beat and beat a lot of those levels to quickly collect mana orbs and demon keys!

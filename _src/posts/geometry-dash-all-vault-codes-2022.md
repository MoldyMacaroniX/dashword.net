You can get easy Geometry Dash icons, ships, UFOs, and more by simply entering some codes. It's free loot!

In Geometry Dash, there are three vaults that you can enter codes in: [The Vault](/posts/geometry-dash-all-vaults-and-secrets-2022/#the-vault), the [Vault of Secrets](/posts/geometry-dash-all-vaults-and-secrets-2022/#vault-of-secrets), and the [Chamber of Time](/posts/geometry-dash-all-vaults-and-secrets-2022/#chamber-of-time). So, here is a comprehensive list of every single vault vode in Geometry Dash.

You can get easy Geometry Dash icons, ships, UFOs, and more by simply entering some codes. It's free loot!

In Geometry Dash, there are three vaults that you can enter codes in: [The Vault](/posts/geometry-dash-all-vaults-and-secrets-2022/#the-vault), the [Vault of Secrets](/posts/geometry-dash-all-vaults-and-secrets-2022/#vault-of-secrets), and the [Chamber of Time](/posts/geometry-dash-all-vaults-and-secrets-2022/#chamber-of-time). So, here is a comprehensive list of every single vault vode in Geometry Dash.

To unlock the Vault of Secrets, [follow these instructions](/posts/geometry-dash-all-vaults-and-secrets-2022/#vault-of-secrets).

However, there are three more tricky codes.

- **[Your Star Count]** — enter how many stars you have
- **Glubfub** — only works if you follow these instructions:
    1. Keep pressing the keymaster NPC face until he mentions Spooky's coin. Keep pressing until the keymaster is done talking about Spooky's coin.
    2. Enter [The Vault](#the-vault-codes) and keep pressing the NPC's face until he mentions Glubfub. Keep pressing until he is done talking about Glubfub.
    3. Go back to the Vault of Secrets and enter the code **Glubfub**.
- **Cod3Breaker** — only works if you follow these instructions:
    1. After entering **Cod3Breaker**, 6 numbers will flash on screen really quickly. Use a screen recorder or another device to record them.
    2. Let's say the numbers are A, B, C, D, E, and F. Perform the following arithmetic:
        - B - A = V
        - C - B = W
        - D - C = X
        - E - D = Y
        - F - E = Z
    3. Then, the code you enter next will be the string of numbers that is VWXYZ.

# Writer (write articles)

Dashword is looking for Geometry Dash related news, guides, and stories, specifically targetted towards new players. Most experienced players don't need a website to tell them [how to unlock The Vault](/posts/geometry-dash-all-vaults-and-secrets-2022/), or [how to beat the Chaos Gauntlet](/posts/geometry-dash-how-to-beat-chaos-gauntlet-easy/).

But new players do, and that's where Dashword comes in.

You can [apply to be a writer using this form](https://forms.gle/GE4NmbumkzNQxntu7). Here are some example articles to give you an idea of what we're looking for:

# Developer (help code the website)

Dashword.net is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) application. If you are familiar with JavaScript, then you'll likely understand the codebase behind the website.

[Dashword is 100% open source](https://github.com/MoldyMacaroniX/dashword.net)! That link leads to the project's GitHub repository, where you can help out. How the website works is documented there, so I recommend reading the README if you want to contribute to the codebase. The project documentation is in the `docs/` folder. -->

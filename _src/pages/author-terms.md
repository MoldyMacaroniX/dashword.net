Thank you for wanting to contribute to Dashword.net, an open source Geometry Dash news source! Our site is made possible by generous contributors such as yourself.

In order for us to publish your Work, you'll have to let us know that you've read and agree to these Terms. We also ask that you use a consistent email address when emailing us so we can verify that it's you. If you lose access to your primary email address, you can [contact us](/contact/) to get things sorted.

First things first: you own your Work. You're giving us permission to publish (and monetize) it, but you can ask us to remove it at any time.
{% endalert %}

# Definitions

- **Terms** - These Author Terms that you're reading right now.
- **Article** - A written post on our website and all content therein. A full (paginated) list of Articles can be [found here](/posts/).
- **Course** - A collection of writing on our website, including all content therein. A full (paginated) list of Courses can be [found here](/courses/).
- **Work** - Any Article or Course that has been submitted for publication and all content therein.
- **Author Page** - A unique page that will display your information along with all your Articles (paginated). A full list of Author Pages can be [found here](/authors/).

# Article or Course Submission

By confirming that we can publish your Article or Course, you agree that:

- You own all rights to your Article or Course and any information of yours you allow us to publish.
- Dashword.net can publicly publish your Work with any changes made to it and monetize it without compensating you. We will still give you attribution for your Work. For Articles, you will be credited on the Article's web page. For Courses, you can credit yourself anywhere in it.
- In addition to publishing your Work, you allow Dashword.net to publish an Author Page consisting of Articles of yours we publish and any of the following information you provide:
    - The username you would like your Work to be published under (this is the only required piece of information, but you can also include any of the ones below if you want)
    - The image you would like to use as an avatar
    - The short, one or two sentence bio for your Author Page
    - Your YouTube, your Twitch, your Twitter, and/or your Discord server
    - Your Geometry Dash profile name
    - The website URL you would like to show on your Author Page
- All information on your unique Author Page will be displayed publicly on our website.
- Your username will be used to generate a unique URL for your Author Page. It will typically be your username, but with any capitals, spaces, or special characters replaced or removed.
- Author Pages only include articles. This also means you need at least one Article to get an Author Page. If you instead are submitting a Course, you can include any of the above information in the Course if you wish.
- We can publish any of the above information, including information part of your Work and Author page, to other sources on the internet (including potentially irrevocable public databases). This is required because some of our systems make use of public sources on the internet to operate (such as GitHub for hosting this website's code and content, some open source content hosting platforms for hosting images, etc). While we can remove anything from our website if you so wish, we can't remove anything from other websites we do not control.
- We are not obligated to host your Work or Author Page forever and can delete them from our website at any time if we so choose.

# Updating/Deleting Your Articles, Courses, and/or Author Page

You can make changes to or remove your Article, Course, or Author Page by emailing us. All changes must be confirmed by us but you can remove your Article, Course, or Author Page at any time. All Articles by you that we publish will be available on your unique Author Page. Courses will be available on our [Courses page](/Courses/) and you can credit yourself in your Course.

You can request copies of your Articles, Courses, or Author Page by emailing us.

Also, because all your articles are linked to your Author Page, if you wish to delete your Author Page, all of your Articles will also get deleted. But Courses will stay up unless you ask we remove them as well.

When requesting changes to your Article, Course, or Author Page, you also agree that any of the new information you wish for us to publish follows these Terms.
